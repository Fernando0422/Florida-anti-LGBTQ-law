<h1><strong> Stop trying to erase queer identity </strong></p></h1>
<p> Bill SB 1834 will oppress the history and voices of queer students and communities. It criminalizes LGBTQ+ identities and encourages ignorance and prejudice. 
</p> <br>
<h4>This is heavily problematic as many students live in situations where they will not be accepted and heavily affect their mental health</h4> 
<h4>The bill feeds into the stigma that LGBTQ+ identity is “inappropriate” and discriminates against queer people. By removing awareness and representation surrounding identity, this bill endangers both education and the lives of students who deserve to be seen. 
</h4>
<h4><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bill SB 1834 will <span style="color: #FFFFFF;">KILL </span>people if it is not prevented.</span></h4>
